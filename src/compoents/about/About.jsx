          <p>Allow me to take a little of your time to introduce myself.</p>
          <p>
            I am a graduate of the Faculty of Science, Department of Chemistry
            from 2018. I work as a medical laboratory specialist, but my hobby
            was programming websites and I obtained a set of certificates in the
            field of front-end development and continued until I became a MERN
            stack developer.‚Äù
